* During the event day, user shows the QR to the organizer to confirm the presence. 
* The organizer can see the real time statistics of the attendee present in the venue, with the specific details filled in the form initially, like age group, gender, grade,etc.

## Why is formiQR important
> formiQR works with Google Forms, which is one of the most common and best survey administration app.
